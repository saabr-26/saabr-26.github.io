Neon Dark Portfolio — Mohd Sabir (template)

## What this is

A small, responsive, dark "neon" portfolio template styled after the screenshot you provided. It is intentionally self-contained and minimal so you can edit content quickly.

## Files created

- `index.html` — main page HTML
- `css/styles.css` — styles (dark neon look)
- `js/scripts.js` — small interactions (theme toggle, smooth scroll)

## How to use

1. Open the folder `portfolio_site` in your editor.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser (double-click or right-click → Open with).

## Customize

- Edit the hero content, name and sections in `index.html`.
- Update colors and spacing in `css/styles.css`.
- Hook a real contact form or mailto in `index.html` and update `js/scripts.js`.

## Deploy

This is a static site; you can deploy it to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any static host. To preview locally, open `index.html` in your browser.

## Notes & next steps

- Add real links for GitHub/LinkedIn and replace placeholder email.
- Optionally add social SVG icons, images, or project screenshots in an `assets/` folder.
- If you want, I can: add a resume PDF link, generate accessible SVG icons, or convert this to a one-page React/Vue app for easier updates.

## Theme

This template now uses a dark "hacker" aesthetic with neon-green accents (terminal-style UI, monospace fonts and a terminal snippet in the hero). Edit `css/styles.css` to tweak colors and fonts.
